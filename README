LCS: Longest Common Subsequence
===============================

Various implementations of the LCS algorithms described by Thomas Guest:
http://wordaligned.org/articles/longest-common-subsequence

I'm starting with verbatim reimplementations of what Thomas wrote. Then I'll
(probably?) be refining them for use in an unspecified use case and unspecified
languages and runtime environments.

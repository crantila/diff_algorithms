LCS: Longest Common Subsequence
===============================

Various implementations of the LCS algorithms described by Thomas Guest:
http://wordaligned.org/articles/longest-common-subsequence


The Algorithms
--------------

There are four algorithms:

- recursive: Easiest to understand but least efficient.
- memoized: A memoized version of the "recursive" algorithm.
- grid: Dynamic programming solution.
- hirschberg: Another algorithm, developed by some dude named Hirschberg.

Pandas
------

I reimplement Guest's algorithms with pandas data structures. This is the cutest version.
